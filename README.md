[00:01.62] Reach for the Biskwiq
[00:12.12] 
[00:13.62] She told me that I'm not enough (yeah)
[00:20.07] And she left me with a broken heart (yeah)
[00:27.06] She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (yeah)
[00:33.14] She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (yeah)
[00:40.06] Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (yeah)
[00:46.51] And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah
[01:14.51] 
[00:53.36] Ooh, I fall apart
[00:58.28] Down to my core
[01:00.56] Ooh, I fall apart
[01:04.95] Down to my core
[01:12.45] 
[01:07.23] Ooh, didn't know it before
[01:11.14] Surprised when you caught me off guard (yo)
[01:14.60] All this damn jewelry I bought
[01:17.88] You was my shorty, I thought
[01:31.88] 
[01:21.44] Never caught a feelin' this hard
[01:24.79] Harder than the liquor I pour
[01:28.03] Tell me you don't want me no more
[01:31.68] But I can't let go
[01:40.68] 
[01:34.61] Everybody told me so
[01:37.86] Feelin' like I sold my soul (yo)
[01:41.35] Devil in the form of a whore
[01:44.56] Devil in the form of a whore
[01:58.56] 
[01:47.22] Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
[01:50.65] Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
[01:53.63] Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
[01:57.02] Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
[02:00.24] Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
[02:03.60] Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
[02:07.00] All these scars can't help from showin'
[02:10.41] Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah
[02:38.41] 
[02:13.32] Ooh, I fall apart
[02:18.33] Down to my core
[02:20.49] Ooh, I fall apart
[02:24.98] Down to my core
[02:32.48] 
[02:27.17] Ooh, didn't know it before
[02:31.15] Surprised when you caught me off guard (yo)
[02:34.60] All this damn jewelry I bought
[02:38.03] You was my shorty, I thought
[02:52.03] 
[03:08.34] Well, it was fun to hang out
[03:10.16] Yeah, totally, maybe I'll see you at school
[03:12.39] Yeah, maybe
